"""Regenerate the table of contents in a hand-maintained markdown doc.

Usage: gen_toc.py <file.md> [--check]

Rewrites whatever sits between the `<!-- toc -->` and `<!-- /toc -->` markers with a nested list of
the document's `##` / `###` headings and GitHub-style anchors. `--check` exits non-zero instead of
writing, so CI can catch a TOC that has drifted from the headings.

A hand-typed TOC in a doc that keeps growing goes stale silently, which is worse than having none —
hence a generator rather than a one-off edit. Headings inside fenced code blocks are skipped, since
a `#` there is a shell comment, not a heading.

Importable as well as runnable: the `gen-12run-*.py` / `gen-plugin-overhead.py` generators call
`build()` directly so their generated documents carry a TOC that cannot drift, since it is rebuilt
from the finished text every time.
